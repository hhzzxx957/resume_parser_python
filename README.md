# Customize
You can customize the parser easily by replacing your own skill, majorslist, world-universities csv in resparser folder.

You can also train your own spacy model (with your own labeled training data from other sources) by using the custom_train.py in model folder. The trained model can replaced the default model in resparser/model/
