# Ranking by education
User can rank multiple resume by education in resume folder. Multiprocessing is enabled when ranking multiple files.

Rank is based on the ranking of the best universities of the world made by [The Times Higher Education for 2020](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/-1/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/scores).

Here is an example output:
```

# Customize
You can customize the parser easily by replacing your own skill, majorslist, world-universities csv in resparser folder.

You can also train your own spacy model (with your own labeled training data from other sources) by using the custom_train.py in model folder. The trained model can replaced the default model in resparser/model/
