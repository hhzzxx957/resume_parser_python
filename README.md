Install neccesary spacy model and nltk words
```bash
# spaCy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# nltk
python -m nltk.downloader words

```bash
python driver.py
```

Done! Result will be printed.

Here is the example result:

```

# Customize
You can customize the parser easily by replacing your own skill, majorslist, world-universities csv in resparser folder.

You can also train your own spacy model (with your own labeled training data from other sources) by using the custom_train.py in model folder. The trained model can replaced the default model in resparser/model/
